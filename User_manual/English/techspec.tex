SALSA onsala is a modified television antenna with a diameter of 2.3~m and designed
to operate at 1420\,MHz.

\section{Angular resolution and accuracy}
\label{sect:ares}
SALSA has an angular resolution of about 6$^\circ$ (\emph{full width half
maximum}) at 1420\,MHz. This value has been measured using the Sun, see Fig.
\ref{fig:beam}. For comparision, remember that the full moon has an angular
diameter of about half a degree, or 30~minutes of arc. The motors track 
in steps of 0.125$^\circ$ around each axis, hence this is the telescope
accuracy in perfect conditions. However, if it is windy\footnote{You can check
the current wind speed at http://wx.oso.chalmers.se/weather/} the telescope
may wobble in the wind (around the wanted position) and hence disturb
the pointing of the telescope during small time intervals with 1-2$^\circ$. 
This should however not be a big concern for users since the wobbles are smaller
than the angular resolution.

visible, as expected for a circular aperture.}

\section{Spectral resolution and accuracy}
The telescope uses the \emph{Universal Software Radio Peripheral} (USRP) to
record data. The USRP acts as a sampler which records a time stream to the hard
drive of the control computer. The channelisation, i.e. construction of the
spectrum, is done in software (FFT). This means that the number of channels
(spectral resolution) is not fixed, nor is the bandwidth. The spectral
resolution is limited by the free space and processing speed of the control
computer. Up to 10\,MHz bandwidth with 8192 channels have been tested, but for
most observations the standard settings of 2\,MHz bandwidth and 256 channels
are sufficient, i.e. a frequency resolution of 7.8\,kHz per channel. If a finer
resolution is needed, it may be selected from the \emph{Advanced} tab in the
\emph{Receiver control} part of the SALSA control program, but we cannot offer
support for these advanced modes yet.
