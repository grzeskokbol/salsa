We have modified the default ThinLinc main.tmpl page to also show some SALSA specific instructions. Keeping cred and link to ThinLinc though. This page lives in /opt/thinlinc/share/tlwabaccess/templates/ and if upgrading ThinLinc it may be autoreplaced. In theory, we should not modify the templates but instead tell the software to use another file. But for now, modifying the template works.
