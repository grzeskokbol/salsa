\section{Remote power control}
Sometimes it is needed to cut the power to a part of the SALSA system,
for example to reboot the USRP. The SALSA electronics are connected to an electric outlet which
can be remotely controlled via internet at

\section{Usage report}
To compile a usage report, go to the Usage Report page on the admin pages in the
SALSA portal. Then, enter date interval to select. Note that long interval, such as a year,
may take a few seconds to load. When loaded, open up LibreOffice Calc. 
With the pointer, mark the table on the webpage and copy it. then
Paste it in a Libreoffice Calc sheet. 
You now have a column with time for each booking. Problem is, the booking
time should be doubled if we have two telescopes for the session. One 
way of doing this is the following> add a new colum besides the one with times.
In one cell in this column, insert
\begin{verbatim}
=IF(OR(B246="Vale, Brage",B246="Brage, Vale "),A246*2,A246)
\end{verbatim}
with 246 being the row numbers, change accordingly.
Then drag downwards, and it will follow the relative cell paths,
causing all duplicated bookings to show dopuble hours. Then, sum
the new time column at the bottom, and you have a total time
for your date range.
