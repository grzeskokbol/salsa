SALSA-Onsala (``Such A Lovely Small Antenna'') is a 2.3~m diameter radio
telescope built at Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden, to introduce pupils,
students and teachers to the marvels of radio astronomy.  The sensitive
receiver makes it possible to detect radio emission from atomic hydrogen far
away in our galaxy, the Milky Way. From these measurements we can learn about
the structure and kinematics of the Milky Way.

This document is not intented for users of SALSA. Instead it is intented
for the support and maintenance of SALSA, as a document to collect
instructions and useful notes about how the system works in detail and how
to fix errors or perform certain support duties.
