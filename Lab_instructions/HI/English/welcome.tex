\chapter{Welcome to the Galaxy}

Looking up on a clear, dark night, our eyes are able to discern a luminous band
stretching across the sky.  Observe it with  binoculars or a small telescope
and you will discover, like Galileo in 1609, that it is made up of a myriad of
stars.  This is the {\bf Milky Way}: our own Galaxy, as it appears from Earth.
It contains about a  hundred billions of stars, and our Sun is just one of
them. There are many other galaxies in the universe. We also refer to the Milky
Way as just {\bf the Galaxy}.

It took astronomers a long time to figure out what the Galaxy really looks
like.  One would like to be able to embark on a spaceship and see the Galaxy
from outside.  Unfortunately, traveling in and around the Galaxy is (and will
always be) out of the question because of the huge distances.  We are condemned
to observe the Galaxy from the vicinity of the Sun.  

%Some areas of the Milky Way appear darker than others in optical light; this is
%because they are obscured by large amounts of interstellar dust, and we can't
%even see the stars that lie behind the dust clouds.

Observations of the Galaxy, as well as of other galaxies, using both with
optical and radio telescopes, have helped unveil the structure of our galaxy.
Today, astronomers think they have good knowledge of how the stars and gas
clouds are distributed.  Our galaxy seems to be a thin disk of stars and gas,
which are distributed in a spiral pattern.

But a new mystery has arisen: that of the so-called {\bf dark matter}.  Most of
the mass of our galaxy seems to be in the form of dark matter, a mysterious
component that has, so far, escaped all means of identification.  Its existence
has been inferred only indirectly. Imagine a couple of dancers, in a dark room.
The man is black, dressed in black clothes, and the woman wears a fluorescent
dress. You can't see the man. But from the motion of the woman dancer, you can
infer his presence: somebody must be holding onto her, otherwise, with such
speed, she would simply fly away!  Similarly, the stars and the gas in our
galaxy rotate {\em too fast}, compared to the amount of mass observed. There
must therefore be {\em more matter}, invisible to our eyes and to the most
sensitive instruments, but which, through the force of gravity, holds the stars
together in our galaxy and prevents them from flying away. The key argument in
favor of the existence of dark matter comes from the measured velocities in the
outer part of our galaxy.  Radio measurements of the type described in this
document have played an important role in revealing the presence of dark matter
in the Milky Way. But what dark matter really is remains an open question.

\section{Our place in the Milky Way}
Our star, the Sun, is located in the outer part of the Galaxy, at a distance of
about 8.5~kpc\footnote{1 kpc = 1 kiloparsec = 10$^3$ pc; 1 parallax-second
(parsec, pc) = 3.086$\cdot 10^{16}$~m.  A parsec is the distance from which the
radius of Earth's orbit subtends an angle of $1''$ (1~arcsec).} (about
25~000~light years\footnote{1 light year (ly) = 9.4605$\cdot 10^{15}$~m}) from
the Galactic center.  Most of the stars and the gas lie in a thin disk and
rotate around the Galactic center.  The Sun has a circular speed of about
220~km/s, and performs a full revolution around the center of the Galaxy in
about 240 million years.

\section{Galactic coordinates: longitude and latitude}
\label{sect:galcoords}
To describe the position of a star or a gas cloud in the Galaxy, it is
convenient to use the so-called {\bf Galactic coordinate system}, $(l,b)$,
where $l$ is the Galactic longitude and $b$ the Galactic latitude (see
Fig.~\ref{figdisc} and Fig.~\ref{figmwsketch}).  The Galactic coordinate system
is centered on the Sun.  $b=0$ corresponds to the Galactic plane. The direction
$b=90\deg$ is called the North Galactic Pole. The longitude $l$ is measured
{\it counterclockwise} from the direction from the Sun toward the Galactic
center.  The Galactic center thus has the coordinates ($l=0,b=0$).  There is,
in fact, something very special at the Galactic center: a very large
concentration of mass in the form of a black hole containing approximately
three million times the mass of the Sun.  Surrounding it is a brilliant source
of radio waves and X-rays called Sagittarius~A*.

approximate locations of the main spiral arms are shown. The
locations of the four quadrants are indicated.}
\label{figmwsketch}
\end{figure}  

The Galaxy has been divided into four quadrants, labeled by 
Roman numbers: 
\bigskip
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lc}
\hbox{Quadrant {\sc I}} 	&0\deg < l < 90\deg	\\
\hbox{Quadrant ${\rm II}$} 	&90\deg < l < 180\deg	\\
\hbox{Quadrant ${\rm III}$} 	&180\deg < l < 270\deg	\\
\hbox{Quadrant ${\rm IV}$} 	&270\deg < l < 360\deg 
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
\bigskip

In Quadrants I and IV we observe mainly the inner part of our Galaxy. Quadrants
II and III contain material at lying  at galacto-centric radii which are always
{\it larger} than the Solar radius (the radius of the orbit of the Sun around
the Galactic center).

\section{Radio emission from atomic hydrogen}
Most of the gas in the Galaxy is atomic hydrogen (H).  H is the simplest atom:
it has only one proton and one electron.  Atomic hydrogen emits a radio line at
a wavelength $\lambda= 21$~cm (or a frequency $f=c/\lambda=1420$~MHz, where
$c\simeq 300 000\, {\rm km/s}$ is the speed of light).  This is the signal we
want to detect. 

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\lambda = 21 \, {\rm cm}
\Rightarrow f=c/\lambda = 1420 \, {\rm MHz}}
\end{equation}

The 21\,cm hydrogen signal is emitted when the electron's spin flips from being
parallel to being antiparallel with the proton's spin, bringing the atom to a
lower energy state (see Fig.~\ref{fighyperfin}).  Although this happens
spontaneously only about once every ten million years for a given hydrogen
atom, the enormous quantity of hydrogen in the Milky Way makes the 21~cm line
detectable.  The line was predicted by the Dutch astronomer H.C. van de Hulst
in 1945, who determined its frequency theoretically.  The line was observed for
the first time in 1951 by three groups, in the U.S.A., in the Netherlands and
in Australia (see Appendix~\ref{app-history}).

caused by the energy change when the electron's spin changes from 
parallel with the proton's spin to antiparallel.}

\section{The Doppler effect}

By observing radio emission from hydrogen, we can learn about the motion of the
hydrogen gas clouds in our Galaxy.  Indeed, it is possible to relate the
observed {\em frequency} of the signal to the {\em velocity of the emitting
gas}, thanks to the so-called {\em Doppler effect}.

This effect, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Johann Doppler
(1803--1853), is also present in our everyday life; for example if you are
standing still in the street and an ambulance {\em approaches} you, it appears
as if the pitch of the ambulance's siren {\em increases}. Similarily, when the
ambulance {\em is receding}, the pitch of the siren {\em decreases}. Because
sound waves travel through a medium (the air), when the ambulance is
approaching the waves will be 'squeezed' together by the forward motion.
Shorter wavelengths mean higher frequency, and thus the pitch of the siren
increases. This effect, that the frequency of the waves changes because of
motion, is the Doppler effect. 

%There is another mechanism we need to understand.  
%One of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th
%century was the theory of Special Relativity, presented by Albert
%Einstein in 1905. A postulate of the theory is
%that the speed of light is constant. We may use a simple example: a
%person stands by the road and watches a car drive towards her at
%a speed of 90 km/h. The driver throws a ball in the direction of the
%car at a speed of 200 km/h. The person standing by the road will
%observe the ball coming towards her at the speed of 90+200=290
%km/s. Imagine that the driver instead would put out a flashlight that
%emits light at the speed of light ($c$), and the person by the road
%would have a way of measuring the speed of the lightbeam coming
%towards her, the velocity of the beam would not be 90~km/h~$+ c$, 
%but only $c$. This is because the speed of light is constant in
%all intertial frames, that is, in non-accelerating frames.
%Einstein showed how the relative motions of the ball and of light could be
%consistent with each other: the former is the low-speed approximation of the
%latter. 
We can use the Doppler effect to relate frequency we observe to the velocity of
the emittin hydrogen gas cloud, but to do so we need a formula. We chose to omit
the rather rather long derivation and just state the important relation between
the observed frequency shift and the velocity:

\begin{equation}
{\boxed{
\frac{\Delta f}{f_0}=-\frac{v}{c}
}}
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{ll}
\Delta f=f-f_0	&\hbox{is the frequency shift}, 	\\
f		&\hbox{is the observed frequency} 	\\
f_0		&\hbox{is
the rest frequency of the line we are observing}	\\
v		&\hbox{is the velocity, $> 0$ if the object is
receding,}						\\
		&\hbox{$< 0$ if it is approaching.}
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}

To observe hydrogen emission from gas clouds in the Galaxy we tune the receiver
of our radio telescope to record frequencies near the rest frequency of the
hydrogen line, i.e. the frequency we would measure if there was no relative
motion. Clouds with different velocities will then appear at different
frequencies. The frequency will be shifted up or down when the signal reaches
us, depending on whether the gas cloud that we observe is approaching us or
receding from us.
