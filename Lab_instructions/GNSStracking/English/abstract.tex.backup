SALSA-Onsala (``Such A Lovely Small Antenna'') is a 2.3~m diameter radio
telescope built at Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden to introduce pupils,
students and teachers to the marvels of radio astronomy. The sensitive
receiver makes possible to detect radio emission from atomic hydrogen far
away in our galaxy. From these measurements one can learn about the kinematics
and distribution of gases in our galaxy, the Milky Way. One can also use
the antenna for other projects which do not involve hydrogen. In this
document we describe how you can observe spectra of signals emitted by
constellation of navigation satellites, which are crucial part of the 
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).\par{}

First, we give a brief introduction to GNSS and its applications. Next, we describe the basic navigation principle. Finally, 
we describe how to use the SALSA control program to detect signals emitted from GNSS satellites.
In the introductory part, the contemporary regional and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) were 
briefly described. Next, the basic principles of satellite positioning were introduced together with the 
description of GNSS signal structure
%Please note that this document only briefly describes the telescope control program. 
%Instructions for operating the SALSA telescope can be found in the document
%entitled \emph{SALSA users manual} available at the SALSA website.
